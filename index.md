Hello! 
<!-- <img src='../files/photo.jpg' style='float:top;width:80%;padding-left:15px'/> -->

I'm Arun Amaithi Rajan, a final year Ph.D. candidate at the [College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University](https://www.annauniv.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. V. Vetriselvi](https://vetriselvivetrian.github.io/). I am currently part of the [Security Research Lab](https://vetriselvivetrian.github.io/security-research-lab), where my research focuses on multimedia security, encompassing image encryption, and privacy-preserving image retrieval. Additionally, I explore cryptographic techniques such as secure computation, encrypted data processing, blockchain technologies, zero-knowledge verification, adversarial attack-resistant learning, and with a keen interest in leveraging LLMs for security applications.

I have contributed to various research articles in high-end journals and conferences. Prior to my doctoral studies, I accumulated over two years of industry experience as a security firmware engineer at [Micron Technologies, Singapore](https://www.micron.com/). In this role, I was involved in client and enterprise NVMe SSD projects, developing secure firmware, resolving critical bugs, and creating internal tools. Additionally, I completed a five-month internship with [PayPal's security team in Singapore](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/home), where I worked on Intel SGX and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) techniques.

<!-- revolve around novel applications of acoustic sensing, as well as sensor security. -->

#### I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in industry R&D or senior security engineering roles. If there are any openings in firmware and embedded security, please feel free to reach out .
